## One more way to search: -

Search for CMU courses or other popular courses like Stanford's CS 224n on LinkedIn and find people who had taken those courses in their past and where are they working right now. 

Focus on CMU ML courses like 10605, 10703, robotics courses like SLAM 16833

```
"10605" "cmu" site:linkedin.com
"16833" "cmu" site:linkedin.com
